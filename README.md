**Echo Server**
- `The client opens a socket connection to the server, with a message serving as the parameter. The message is sent to the server through the socket. The server then assembles the message piece-by-piece until it is fully assembled. Once the message is fully assembled, the message is returned then the socket is closed.`

**Socket HTTP Server, Step 1**
- `The client receives an HTTP response based the input provided.`
